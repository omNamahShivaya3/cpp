what is linked list?
It is a type of linear data structure. 

grow & shrink at run time in l.l. therefore no memory wastage as compared to vector, and array doesn't allow changing size. 

insertion and deletion is easy. No shift needed. 

It is unlike array, non-contigious memory locations.

Types of l.l.
->Singly l.l.
->Doubly l.l.
->Circular l.l.
->Circular doubly l.l.

->Singly l.l.
Linked list is collection of nodes.
Node contains data and address.
